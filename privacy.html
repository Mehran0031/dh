    <h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction and Our Commitment</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to Digital Harmony Studio's Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we collect, use, and share your information. This policy explains our privacy practices for our AI-powered music generation and distribution platform, including our integrations with social media platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and music streaming services.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Our Privacy Philosophy:</strong> We believe that privacy is a fundamental right. We collect only the information necessary to provide and improve our services, and we give you control over your data. We never sell your personal information to third parties.
    </div>
    
    <p>Our commitment extends beyond mere compliance with privacy regulations. We have designed our platform with privacy-by-design principles, ensuring that data protection is integrated into every aspect of our service architecture. This comprehensive approach means that privacy considerations are embedded in our AI algorithms, data processing workflows, and user interface design from the ground up.</p>
    
    <p>We understand that trust is earned through consistent action and transparency. Therefore, we provide clear explanations of our data practices, offer meaningful choices about your information, and maintain robust security measures to protect your data. Our privacy practices are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect evolving privacy standards and user expectations.</p>

    <h1 id="information-collect">2. Information We Collect</h1>
    
    <p>We collect information in several ways to provide you with our AI music generation and distribution services. The information we collect falls into carefully defined categories, each serving specific purposes in delivering and improving our services.</p>
    
    <h2>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h2>
    
    <p>When you interact with our platform, you provide various types of information that enable us to deliver personalized music generation and distribution services.</p>
    
    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>Your account information forms the foundation of your Digital Harmony Studio experience. This includes your name and email address, which serve as your primary identifiers within our system. We collect your username and password to secure your account access, along with profile information and preferences that help us customize your experience. Contact information enables us to communicate important service updates and respond to your inquiries.</p>
    
    <p>We also collect information about your music creation preferences, including your preferred genres, typical track specifications, and creative requirements. This information is crucial for our AI algorithms to generate music that aligns with your artistic vision and style preferences.</p>
    
    <h3>Music Creation Data</h3>
    <p>The heart of our service revolves around understanding your creative intentions and translating them into high-quality music content. We collect detailed information about your music genre preferences, which helps our AI models understand the stylistic elements you favor. Track specifications and requirements provide technical parameters that guide the generation process, ensuring the output meets your specific needs.</p>
    
    <p>Creative prompts and descriptions you provide are analyzed by our natural language processing systems to understand the emotional tone, narrative elements, and artistic direction you want to achieve. The generated music content itself becomes part of your creative portfolio within our platform, stored securely and accessible according to your preferences.</p>
    
    <h2>2.2 Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
    
    <p>Our platform automatically collects certain information to ensure optimal performance, security, and user experience. This automated collection is designed to be minimally intrusive while providing the necessary data for service improvement.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We collect information about how you use our platform, including pages visited, features used, time spent, and interaction patterns. This helps us improve our AI algorithms and user experience.
    </div>
    
    <p>Device information, including your device type, operating system, and browser details, helps us optimize our platform's performance across different technical environments. IP address and location data, collected only with your consent, enable us to provide region-appropriate services and comply with local regulations.</p>
    
    <h2>2.3 Information from Third-Party Integrations</h2>
    
    <p>When you choose to connect your accounts from other platforms, we may receive specific information that enhances your Digital Harmony Studio experience while respecting the privacy policies of those platforms.</p>
    
    <div class="snapchat-box">
        <strong>Snapchat Integration:</strong> Through Snapchat's Login Kit and Creative Kit, we may receive your display name, Bitmoji avatar, and sharing permissions. This integration is designed to comply fully with Snapchat's privacy requirements and developer guidelines. We only access the minimum information necessary to provide the integration functionality you've requested.
    </div>
    
    <div class="ai-box">
        <strong>🤖 AI and Machine Learning Data Usage</strong><br><br>
        Our AI music generation system processes your creative inputs to generate personalized music content. This includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Analysis of your music preferences and style choices</li>
            <li>Processing of text prompts and creative descriptions</li>
            <li>Learning from your feedback to improve future generations</li>
            <li>Aggregated usage patterns to enhance our AI models</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Your individual creative inputs are not shared with other users, and we implement privacy-preserving techniques in our AI training processes.
    </div>

    <h1 id="how-we-use">3. How We Use Your Information</h1>
    
    <p>We use the information we collect for specific, clearly defined purposes that directly relate to providing and improving our services. Our data usage practices are designed to be transparent, purposeful, and aligned with your expectations as a user of our platform.</p>
    
    <h2>3.1 Core Service Provision</h2>
    
    <p>The primary use of your information is to deliver the core functionality of Digital Harmony Studio. AI music generation represents the heart of our service, where we process your creative prompts, preferences, and specifications to generate personalized music content that meets your artistic vision.</p>
    
    <p>Platform distribution functionality utilizes your account information and distribution preferences to automatically publish your generated music to your selected streaming and social media platforms. This automated process saves you time while ensuring consistent and strategic content distribution across multiple channels.</p>
    
    <h2>3.2 Service Improvement and Personalization</h2>
    
    <p>We analyze usage patterns and user feedback to continuously improve our AI algorithms and overall platform functionality. This analysis helps us understand which features are most valuable to our users and where we can make improvements to enhance the user experience.</p>
    
    <p>Personalization efforts focus on tailoring your Digital Harmony Studio experience to your individual preferences and creative style. This includes customizing the user interface, suggesting relevant features, and optimizing AI-generated content to better match your artistic preferences.</p>

    <h1 id="information-sharing">4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h1>
    
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not sell your personal information to third parties. Our approach to information sharing is based on necessity, transparency, and user control. We share information only in specific, limited circumstances that directly support the services you've requested or are required by law.</p>
    
    <h2>4.1 Third-Party Platform Integrations</h2>
    
    <p>When you choose to connect and share content through our platform integrations, we share only the necessary information to enable the functionality you've requested. This sharing is always subject to your explicit consent and can be controlled through your account settings.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Your Control:</strong> You can disconnect any platform integration at any time through your account settings. Disconnecting an integration will stop future data sharing with that platform, though previously shared content may remain subject to that platform's own data retention policies.
    </div>
    
    <h2>4.2 Service Providers and Partners</h2>
